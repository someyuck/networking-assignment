# Assumptions
1. For partA/basic, after one run of the TCP client-server pair programs, wait for some time, as immediately after a run, the address may still be in use (bind() throws an error). Waiting for some time would free it up and then we can run both programs again.
2. For partA/rpc, run the UDP programs with the server run first, then the clients, as I make the server wait for a confirmation from the clients that they are ready to play. For the TCP programs, run in any order.
3. For partB, to test the retransmission of packets in case of the sender not receivng acknowledgements of some packets from the receiver, uncomment part of functions.c (lines 216 to 217), and part of server.c (line 66). Keep them commented to enable full acknowledgement of received packets.
